Its sensitivity to ultra-violet light lends itself to sun-based investigations. It can also be used as a measuring tool for any other UV light source, or as a photographic medium to use in scientific experiements. Get some ideas for scientific use from our Activities Page.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"sunprints-mode\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/wp-coda\/images\/sunprints_about_art.jpg\" alt=\"Art\" width=\"252\" height=\"160\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Art with the Power of the Sun<\/h3>\n<p>Sunprint Kits are based on the cyanotype process, which has been used by artists since its development in the 19th century. Objects that eclipse the sun&#8217;s light will show up in white, with the rest of the paper turning a vibrant Prussian Blue. Gradients between these two ends are easy to achieve. Make prints of physical objects or transfer digital images via transparency sheet. Layering techniques, motion, and manipulation of the paper itself are all implements in the Sunprint Kit user&#8217;s toolbox.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"sunprints-mode\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/wp-coda\/images\/sunprints_about_fun.png\" alt=\"Fun\" width=\"252\" height=\"160\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Hands-on Fun<\/h3>\n<p>Sunprint Kits make for a great hands-on activity to do with groups. Whether it be in the classroom, in a camp, a museum workshop, birthday party or any other group setting, get people together, share ideas and play. Discounts for educational programs are available.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About Sunprint Kits The History of Sunprint Kits Since 1975, the Sunprint Kit has provided fun, learning and creative stimulation for the curious of all ages.
