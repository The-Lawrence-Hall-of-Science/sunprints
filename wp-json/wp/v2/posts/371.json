Jared Tarbell is an artist who, as he describes it,<br \/>\n\u201cwrite[s] computer programs to create graphic images. With an algorithmic goal in mind, I manipulate the work by finely crafting the semantics of each program. Specific results are pursued, although occasionally surprising discoveries are made.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-395\" src=\"http:\/\/www.sunprints.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/cubic-attractor-0001.jpg\" alt=\"cubic attractor 0001\" width=\"349\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sunprints.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/cubic-attractor-0001.jpg 349w, https:\/\/www.sunprints.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/cubic-attractor-0001-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.sunprints.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/cubic-attractor-0001-299x300.jpg 299w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This sounds a lot like\u2026what we do with Sunprints! And the fine lines of his work lend themselves to two-toned cyanotypes.\u00a0 So I made prints of the computation images.\u00a0 The results were striking.  And as he says on his website, modifications of his work are encouraged.

I chose pieces out of his online gallery, and set the color to black and white.  For a few, I increased the contrast, to make for a clearer print, and played around with inversing the images.  I printed them out on transparencies, running it through the printer two or three times to get the image dark enough.  Then I set it out to print on just like usual, with the transparency on the paper, acrylic on top to hold it down, and the whole unit on cardboard to keep it clean.  Expose until bluish white (2-5 minutes, depending on cloud cover), soak for 45 seconds, and dry and develop and press under heavy books. And voila! A new take on an already stunning work of art.  And if you know how to write computer programs, you can make your own computation patterns to print!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-397\" src=\"http:\/\/www.sunprints.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/non-linear-substrate-3001.jpg\" alt=\"non-linear substrate 3001\" width=\"263\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sunprints.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/non-linear-substrate-3001.jpg 263w, https:\/\/www.sunprints.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/non-linear-substrate-3001-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jared Tarbell is an artist who \u201cwrite[s] computer programs to create graphic images.&#8221; I made prints of the computation images, and the  results were striking.
